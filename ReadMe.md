# MediaKeys
Little script that allows you to use Home, End, PgUp, PgDwn, Pause|Break as media keys.  
You might have to open your playback window (e.g. Spotify) once, before the program works.  
A gray tray icon means the program is in idle mode, press the Scroll Lock key to turn it on.  
Home is then previous song, End is next song, PageUp is volume up and PageDown is volume down.  
The Pause|Break key next to Scroll Lock will always pause/resume, even with Scroll Lock inactive.
